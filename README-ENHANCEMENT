engine_pkcs 0.9.1 does not provide a way to get a certificate from
a PKCS#11 hard token when accessed from OpenSSL.  This enhancement extends
the engine to support the OpenSSL ENGINE_load_ssl_client_cert()
function, which returns among other things a x509 certificate.  

Since the function provides no way that I can see to specify which
certificate to "load", the implementation done this by adding a method to the
engine to set the certificate name (slot-id). It is used before actually getting the
certificate.  The way the function would be used when interfacing with
OpenSSL would be roughly as follows:

       // Set the certificate name (slot-id) to use for a subsequent certificate request
       ENGINE_ctrl_cmd(e, "CERT_ID", strlen(cert_name), cert_name, NULL, 0);

       // Get the certificate from the engine
       ENGINE_load_ssl_client_cert(e, https_ssl, ca_dn, &cert,
									&key,&othercerts, NULL,NULL);

       //  Use the certificate when establishing an SSL session
       SSL_CTX_use_certificate(https_ctx, cert);


The model is similar to the way that engine is used for setting the
PIN as follows:

       ENGINE_ctrl_cmd(e, "PIN", strlen(pin), pin, NULL, 0);

Subsequent engine private key functions use the PIN if one set;
otherwise, the user is prompted.
